# FifthCharacter
FifthCharacter is a comprehensive player character sheet compatible with the 5th Edition of [Dungeons & Dragons](https://dnd.wizards.com/). It is automated so that you the player can focus more on the DM/GM and less on making sure your sheet is up to date.
## Automations
FifthCharacter aims to bring intuitive automations to your D&D experience to help you focus on the game and prevent mistakes. These automations include:
 - **Leveling**: by using either the default XP system or milestone based leveling, character levelup becomes an automatic process, simplifying the process by adding all relevant features and prompting for new spells and how to increase maximum hit points so all you have to do is make decisions. No more forgetting what features a 6th level Rogue gains or forgetting to increase your maximum hit dice. Multiclassing supported as well!
 - **Rests**: taking a long or short rest comes at the push of a button, no more having to keep track of what does and doesn't get reset. Short rests will also prompt for hit dice usage.
 - **Spells**: never forget what spells are included by your class, subclass, race, background, etc. again. With a fully automated spell list, you only have to add the spells you choose. So you don't have to remember that your 3rd Level Artillerist Artificer always has Shield and Thunderwave prepared.
 - **Features and Spell Slots**: never forget whether or not you've used a once per day or once per rest feature, or how many spell slots you've expended. Combined with automatic resting, you'll always know where you can use your Breath Weapon or Second Wind, and use them correctly.
## Reference
FifthCharacter aims to be your all-in-one player app so you don't have to be rummaging through books or companion apps to find out the area of effect for Fireball. These references include:
 - **Spells**: never forget how a spell works, just tap on it in your spell list and it shows you all the information you need.
 - **Weapons**: never forget what properties your weapons have, again, just tap op it.
 - **Features**: never forget what your racial or class features do, one tap descriptions and usages. Features like Second Wind are automatic too!
